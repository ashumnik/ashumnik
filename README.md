# Hi, I'm Aleksei 👋

I'm a software engineer with a Master's degree in Software Engineering and over 5 years of experience in system-level development.

Specialized in:
- ⚙️ C/C++, Linux, multithreading, asynchronous programming  
- 🌐 Network protocols, TCP/IP, VPN, low-level socket programming  
- 🧠 System architecture, performance optimization, and debugging

I’ve worked on embedded systems, routing software, and security-focused products, often in international, distributed teams.

I care about clean code, thoughtful design, and solving real-world problems through engineering.  

Currently: exploring machine learning, distributed systems, and everything between software and hardware. 🚀

Always open to meaningful collaboration. 🤝
